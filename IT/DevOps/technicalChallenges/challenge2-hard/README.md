üõ†Ô∏è Building a Stateless Image for the SSG Part of Next.js
Problem Statement

You are tasked with creating a Build/Test/Deploy Dockerfile that results in a stateless image for the Static Site Generation (SSG) part of Next.js.

The image should be optimized for production use and should include the necessary steps to build, test, and deploy the SSG component of a Next.js application.
Requirements

    The Dockerfile should result in a stateless image.
    The image should include the necessary steps to build the SSG component of a Next.js application.
    The image should include the necessary steps to test the SSG component of the application.
    The image should include the necessary steps to deploy the SSG component of the application.
    The image should be optimized for production use.

## Bonus

    Use environment variables for configuration where applicable
    Include additional steps for security hardening of the image

Let's get started with building a robust and secure Docker image for the SSG component of Next.js!
